## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

# Basic R functions 

# (Shortcut to run chunk Ctrl + Shift + Enter)
# (Shortcut to run line Ctrl + Enter)

#Assignments (Shortcut is Alt + -)
A <- 50
A

#Concatenation
B <- c(1,2,3)
B

#Quick list
C <- c(-10:10,2) #Does -10 to 10 then adds a 2 as last element
C

#Repetition
y <- c(2:4)
y
rep(y,3) #Repeats y 3 times, like c(y,y,y)
rep(y,times=3) #Same as previous
rep(y,each=3) #Repeats y each element 3 times

#Sequencing
D <- c(seq(-10,10,5),"A") #Sequence from -10 to 10 by 5 and add string A
D

#List Vars
ls() #shows all defined vars
rm(A) #removes var A from list of vars
ls()
#rm(list=ls()) #removes all vars

#Finding NA
z <- c(1,NA,2,NA,3,4,5)
z
is.na(z)  #Returns a Boolean vector on which is NA, True for Yes
```
```{r}

#Basic R operations Function (Works on vectors as well)
exp(A)
1/(A)
A^3
y <- A+17
y

exp(B)
B*100


#Finding max and min of Vector
B
min(B)    #returns min value in B
max(B)    #returns max value in B
which.max(B)    #returns position of max element in B
B <- c(B,1)   
B
which(B==min(B))    #returns all the positions of min element in B

#Finding max and min of many vectors
max(B,C)
pmax(B,C) #parallel max (E.g. compares B[1] with C[1] and returns max)
```
```{r}

#Vector operation
C
sum(C)    #sum all elements in C
which(C==0)
C <- C[-11]   #Assign C without the 0 to C
C    #Print new C
prod(C)   #multiply all elements in C
mean(C)   #find the mean of C
sd(C)   #find standard deviation of C
summary(C)

```
